# Tally Extract
This is a command line program used to extract tally data from MCNP
output files. It is primarily used by the Reactor Engineer at the MIT
Nuclear Reactor Laboratory to help analyze data generated in the course
of reactor physics simulations.

## Usage
From the command line run `tally-extract`. It takes the path to an MCNP
output file as it's argument and generates an Excel workbook as it's
output. You can optionally specify the output file name to write.

    tally-extract -o [output-file] <input-file>
